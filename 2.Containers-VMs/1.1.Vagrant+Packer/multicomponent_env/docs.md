# Overview

This project sets up a multi-node Vagrant environment with two virtual machines (VMs) for educational and testing purposes. The VMs can communicate with each other using a private network and all of them have access to the web.

# Notes

The IP addresses for VMs are assigned on a private network (192.168.33.x).
Internet connectivity is provided through NAT.

I've also made dynamic Vagrantfile for the purpose of using many machines with different configurations. To be updated.
